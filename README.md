# Transformer Networks for Trajectory Forecasting
This is the code for the paper **Transformer Networks for Trajectory Forecasting** editted for evaluation on the ETH-UCY split sampled according to TrajNet++ procedure and TrajNet++ benchmark.

TrajNet++ sampling allows to focus on pedestrians of interest that undergo social interactions, while ignoring non-essential trajectories like static trajectories.


## Requirements
  - Pytorch 1.0+
  - Numpy
  - Scipy
  - Pandas
  - Tensorboard
  - trajnetplusplustools

## Scripts
Refer to Makefile for generating clusters, training and evaluation scripts.
We directly provide the generated clusters in 'datasets' folder.
